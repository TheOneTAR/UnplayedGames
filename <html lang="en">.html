          <p>This is a handy <span class="comment">(not really)</span> little tool that tells you how long and how many people it would take, on average, to play all the unplayed games in your BGG collection.</p>

          <p>It assumes that your collection is somewhat up to date, and that you log your plays. It also assumes you're very social and only ever play one game with someone. <span class="comment">Or would that make you unsocial?</span></p>
